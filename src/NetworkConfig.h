/**
 * @todo - Wifi setup process in case no permanent setup yet done
 * @todo - RingBuffer hack to be reviewed
 * @todo - Review DIAGS in the code and put at the right level ( ev reorder to have info at 3 )
 * @todo - check error conditions and instrument them ( buffer overruns in particular!! )
 * @todo - setup the WiFi 'shield' on any serial port / Software Serial. 
 * @todo - test Wifi/Ethernet UDP with multiple WiThrottles; build a test runner for this
 * @todo - documentation / Doxygen to be generated ...
 * @todo - add warning if all connections available are in use. i.e. the next connection opened will not go through but wait until a connection gets available
 * @todo - start on the CLI 
 * @todo - check if the number of connections is global or per [Ethernet|WiFi]Server instance ...
